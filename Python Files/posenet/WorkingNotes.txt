Project 
    - What other methods are avialable to detect ball??
        - Resenet50 CNN regression?
            - What does the dataset format look like? (Image and points)
                - A points file txt file
                    - With same filename
                    
            - What is a datapoint going to be?
            - Are there any such dataset ot there?
                -http://ipl.ce.sharif.edu/ball_datasets.html
                - http://basketballattention.appspot.com/
            - How is the process of collecting the dataset?

Download videos
    - Take screen shots 
    - Label them


- I am trying to test CAT regression on a single image 
    -  export the export.pkl file 
    -  It contains the following
        - (the model, the weights but also some metadata like the classes or the transforms/normalization used).
    - Yes, Restnet is able to predict where ears and nose even in occlusion.

STEPS:
        -  Create the learner
        -  Load the weights
        - Export the learner


Creating Basketball DataSet
    - Get frames at given timstamps
        - x1000 to get timestamp in mircoseconds
        - Convert it to seconds
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=SECONDS!!!!!&v=VIDEOIDDDD
            -example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2805&v=AALM9_RgV6c
        - Is there a way I can extract out the frame form youtube videos?
    - Given an Screen shot I know where the ball is
    - Get screen shots
        - Get a screen shot using code (DONE)
            - Login to youtube 
            - Use the page to search for a vidoeo's screen shot 
        -Get screen shots of the sent urls 
            - resize the image in JS
            - Redirect the chrome downloaded item to a dataset folder
            - Build a function that send a JSON STRING
                - REQUEST STRING:
                        - '{links:{0:'link1',1:link2.....}}
                        - '{links:'link1,line2.....'}' (USING THIS)
                    - What is the best way to send this data
                        - We need to use a middleeware to be able recieve data outside params 
                            - var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
                            - app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }))
                            - data will be available on req.body.links
                            - app.post() will take aynsc function
                - JSONIFY THEM 
                - PROCCESS EACH LINK 
                - SEND THE IMAGE
                - REAPEAT UNTIL ALL THE LINKS HAVE BEEN PPROCCESSD!
